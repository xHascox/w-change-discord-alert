## WCDA

WCDA is a simple monitoring script that sends a discord message to a user whenever a new login is detected with the "w" command. This might help to detect unauthorized access to servers.

## Usage:

`nohup python3 alerter.py`

Change the "DISCORD_API_TOKEN" and the "DISCORD_USER_ID_TO_BE_ALERTED" in the source code before running.
